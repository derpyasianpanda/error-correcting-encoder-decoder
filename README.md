# Error Correcting Encoder/Decoder

This project works closely with binary numbers and bytes. Using bit operations, this program can encode the given "send.txt" file to a format that can handle up to one bit errors.

The program uses two Encoding/Decoding/Correcting techniques, Hamming Codes and Double-Bit. It features random error simulation and can print out the binary and hexadecimal representations at each stage to help visualize the process.

## Instructions

- Ensure a "send.txt" message is in the root directory
- Compile/Build the Main.java (with Javac or your IDE)
- Run the Main class (with Java or your IDE)
- Run encode, send, and decode in that order

> Note: I will update this README and comment the code soonâ„¢
